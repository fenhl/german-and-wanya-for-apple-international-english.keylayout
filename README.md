This is the macOS keyboard layout I use on Apple International English hardware keyboards. It provides convenient access to letters used in German (äöüß) and the conlangs [Wanya](http://www.frathwiki.com/Wanya) (Бꝛə) and [Viossa](http://www.frathwiki.com/Viossa) (◌̌◌́ŋ) as well as some other useful characters, while maintaining all mappings shown on the physical keys.

# Installation

1. Copy the file `German and Wanya for Apple International English.keylayout` into `/Library/Keyboard Layouts`.
2. Reboot.
3. In System Preferences → Keyboard → Input Sources, click the + button, scroll down in the language list to select Others, then choose “German and Wanya for US International”.
